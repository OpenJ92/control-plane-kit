# Roadmap 0008 Gate G Overnight Run 0001

Date: 2026-07-19

Branch: `roadmap/0008-activity-execution-and-runtime-mutation`

Parent: #402

## Operating Contract

This run continues Gate G autonomously from the completed #403 capability,
#443 protocol, and #444 configuration foundations. Ordinary test failures,
fixture drift, missing interpreter cases, and coherent algebra extensions are
diagnostic events to resolve and record rather than automatic operator stops.

The run still stops for unresolved authorization, secret-disclosure,
destructive-retention, transaction-ownership, paid-cloud, or genuinely
ambiguous architectural decisions. Tests may be corrected only when their
intended law is preserved or strengthened.

Docker remains the only concrete runtime. Unused Docker resources may be
removed if storage is exhausted, but these running Pottery Factory containers
must remain untouched:

```text
pottery-factory-cloudflare
pottery-factory-auth
pottery-factory-storage
pottery-factory-api
pottery-factory-postgres
```

## Baseline

```text
Roadmap branch head: d599b50
Complete Docker/Postgres suite: 786 tests, OK
Live transport proof: TCP and UDP, OK
Live configuration proof: typed render, read-only mount, replay, cleanup, OK
```

## Issue Reconciliation

The run begins by comparing open issue claims with merged PRs, tests, and the
current package. An issue is closed only when its complete acceptance evidence
already exists.

| Issue | Classification | Evidence and action |
|---|---|---|
| #467 | Stale completed hardening issue | PR #469 merged concurrent exact-artifact convergence, 779-test validation, and live configuration proof. Close with evidence. |
| #340 | Stale completed Gate E issue | PR #342 merged the canonical nullable failure descriptor through read service, FastAPI, MCP, and CLI with 652-test validation. Close with evidence. |
| #241 | Intentional open handoff parent | Roadmap 0008 children #242-#245 are complete, but #246 deliberately remains a Roadmap 0009 prerequisite. Keep open; do not pull CPI lifecycle semantics into Gate G. |
| #1, #5-#7, #9, #61-#63 | Stale completed Roadmap 0004 topology | Roadmap PR #60 and child PRs #64-#71 delivered and reviewed the HTTP teaching-server catalogue. Close each with its exact PR evidence. |
| #8 | Genuine future product work | TCP switching and Postgres pooling remain represented by Gate G #429/#431. Keep open until those products deliberately supersede or complete it. |
| #86-#92, #103 | Stale completed Roadmap 0006 topology | PRs #94, #96-#101, and #104 delivered and hardened the shared read service plus projection, FastAPI, CLI, and MCP adapters. Close each with exact evidence. |

Issues #12, #16, #18, and #19 are not closed merely because later work is
adjacent. Their original acceptance scopes require a separate comparison and
are not prerequisites for #457.

## Breaking Points

### #473: Architecture ownership rejected the new package

The first complete Docker/Postgres run reached 793 tests with 792 passing. The
architecture test rejected the newly discovered `verification` package because
it had no declared dependency rule.

This was not resolved by excluding the package. The dependency algebra was
extended explicitly:

```text
verification -> types
algebra      -> verification
topology     -> verification
```

`verification` remains pure and owns no transport, persistence, workflow, or
runtime dependencies. This preserves the AST policy's exhaustiveness: adding a
new package without declaring its permitted imports continues to fail.

## #473 Decision Log: Closed Verification Contract

### Capability

Blocks can now declare bounded semantic checks as part of `BlockSpec` product
truth. The contract survives compilation and the authoritative graph codec, but
does not execute yet.

```python
BlockSpec(
    role_id="orders-api",
    verification=VerificationContract(
        checks=(
            HttpCheck(
                check_id="can-list-orders",
                provider_socket="public",
                path="/internal/tests/orders",
            ),
        ),
    ),
)
```

The closed language contains HTTP, DNS, Postgres, Redis, broker, object-storage,
and SMTP checks. Every variant has an exact protocol set. `PostgresQueryCheck`
deliberately exposes only the closed `SELECT_ONE` operation; there is no SQL
string. HTTP checks carry a relative path and provider socket identity, never a
URL.

### Objects, Morphisms, And Laws

```text
VerificationCheck
  = HttpCheck
  | DnsResolveCheck
  | PostgresQueryCheck
  | RedisCheck
  | BrokerRoundTripCheck
  | ObjectStorageRoundTripCheck
  | SmtpAcceptanceCheck

VerificationContract -> exact descriptor -> VerificationContract
VerificationCheck    -> accepted provider protocols
```

- policies bound timeout, attempts, and evidence bytes;
- contract check identities are unique and bounded;
- descriptor keys and variants are exact and fail closed;
- `BlockSpec` rejects untyped contract values at construction;
- process, transport, application-health, and readiness probes remain unchanged;
- no interpreter, transport, store, or external effect was introduced.

### Evidence

```text
Focused Docker tests: 27 passed before review strengthening
Complete Docker/Postgres suite after AST ownership correction: 793 passed
Final complete Docker/Postgres suite: 795 passed
Test skips added: 0
Assertions weakened: 0
```

### Handoff To #474

Validate every check against the provider socket on its compiled node, preserve
contract changes as graph differences, and materialize endpoint-bearing check
requests only from the exact graph pinned by the approved plan. Adapters must
not import stores or choose current graph truth.
